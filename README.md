this is a summary of what ive learned from this project: This project has showed me with prompt engineering and adding clauses as you go on you can get pretty good code but if you do a lot of promts based on one part of the code and tell it to not modify any of the other components than it will soon begin to screw up other parts of the code for example i was trying to make a look around command that would give a general discription of the area but once i got that figured out the "use gadget" command stopped doing damage to enemy's.       NOTE!!: USE THE 0.3 VERSION FOR ALL WORKING FEATURES
